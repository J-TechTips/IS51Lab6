"""
To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 and 20, and 
based on the restult of the random number, we check to see if it falls under certain range
if the number is greater than 15, then the results will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result will be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is > 5, then the result will be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is > 2, then the result will be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is > 1, then the result will be "Bell"
if the number is not any of the above, then the result will be "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three trimes and print the results to the user.
